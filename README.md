# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.

## How to run:

Install node.JS, Express.JS on your machine.
In your terminal, select folder that this project is in, and do command "node start".
Upon starting, you should expect to see the phrase "Listening on port 1234".
Done!

## Usage:

### Updating nickname
In the chat box, type "/nick" followed by a space and your desired nickname. 
For example, I type /nick deb to replace username from UserN (N being an 
arbitrary number) to deb.
